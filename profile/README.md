# Chess Game Challenge
For the Embedded Systems course at PUC Minas, our group decided to make a smart chessboard that could teach people how to play chess by detecting every move and indicating correct moves, mistakes and attacks. The system has a PVP mode and also single-player mode connected with chess AI services.
